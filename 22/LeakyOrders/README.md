# Broken Take away
Last week we switched over to a new cash machine systems.
But the engineer who installed the system made a mistake, and now our orders dont't arrive propperly.
All the dish numbers are leaked to you screen and now it is up to you to send them back in time.

Do you think you can help us send the correct orders to the cashier?
If you can, we will reward you with a freshly cooked flag!
